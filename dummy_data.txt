Google Oct 13, 2021 very happy with the service I received from my sales person Clay Foust ,and I am ordering another c8 corvette ,this is a very friendly fair dealership Google Oct 11, 2021 Out standing service ,My sales person Clay knows all about the C8 corvette ,I would buy from them again Google Sep 27, 2021 This is a great dealership to do business with and is locally owned! From Travis Wolford and Russ Thomas to my salesman Chris Ivey, they are top notch! Highly recommended! Google Sep 24, 2021 Awesome service department!!! DealerRater Sep 12, 2021 Best car buying experience we have ever had. Trevor, our salesman was amazing, very professional and honest about everything. He made sure to answer every question we had and explained, in detail all the features on the vehicle. Highly recommend purchasing a vehicle at this location. Google Sep 10, 2021 We had a great experience with Tyler in Sales and Paul in Financing. We are extremely happy with our new Trailblazer! We have had a lot of good experiences with the Service Department previously, but this was our first buying experience and they really did a fantastic job! Would highly recommend! Google Sep 10, 2021 Great experience! I had talked to Clay for a month finding the perfect Tahoe. They found it and Trevor toke care of me when I got there. Great customer service. Google Sep 8, 2021 Excellent Service! Jeff & Joe was very Helpful! Google Sep 4, 2021 Clay was AWESOME! Everyone was very kind and pleasant to work with. They made the buying experience easy and stress free! Google Sep 2, 2021 I’m not guna lie, first couple of days I thought they were blowing smoke and were just going to rip me. I do almost all of my repairs. But Joe found a part in this shortage and saved me several thousand. I will be back! Thanks joe Google Sep 1, 2021 After having completed body work on my CHEVY 2015 Colorado at Rusty Wallace Collision center, who did excellent job ,they then took my truck over to Rusty Wallace dealership for recall part to be fixed /replaced. Both did a great job working together on this. Pleased. Google Aug 26, 2021 Tyler was very professional and truly a great person. He showed us multiple vehicles taking us back and forth across the lot. Lets just say he is very willing to work hard to make the customer happy. My wife and I couldn't have been treated any better. I will most certainly be working with Tyler in the future and sending him business. Google Aug 25, 2021 Came in with a service engine light problem and was provided a full inspection to validate that nothing was wrong. The service was very quick and friendly. We appreciated the team helping us out. Google Aug 23, 2021 Awesome. That's how I would describe my visit. It was just a couple of hours and the salesman had helped me get the vehicle I wanted. I was hesitant at first due to no money down and my credit score. But the team at Rusty Wallace took great care to get me what I wanted. I really want to thank Chris Ivey for his help. He was great from start to finish. I would recommend everyone give these people a chance to help you into a new vehicle. I tried two other places and they both were very disappointing. One tried to get me to pay $700 a month for a vehicle I didn't even want. The crew at Rusty Wallace got me out the door paying $447 with insurance added in. These guys are great. Thank you again Chris. Google Aug 19, 2021 This was the best car buying experience I have ever had. The whole team was incredible. From the moment we walked in the door we actually felt like they wanted to help us, which is not the case in some other dealerships around here. We worked with Clay and Shannon and the whole process could not have gone smoother. They were very accommodating and patient as we made our decision. I would recommend Rusty Wallace Chevy to anyone who is looking to buy a car or trade theirs in, and ask for Clay and Shannon, they were amazing! Google Aug 16, 2021 Friendly, helpful and great service. Answered all my questions. Google Aug 10, 2021 Chris Ivey was great! Definitely recommend him to anyone that wants a new vehicle! Google Aug 7, 2021 8/2/21 I was on the search for a White 2500hd LT trim package. I live in Pensacola. Fl (500 miles away). I came across Rusty Wallace Chevrolet, and spoke with Clay Foust. Clay was cordial, sincere and professional. I placed a deposit on the truck and flew up to Knoxville 3 days later. I was introduced to the GM Shannon and was equally impressed. Their staff went above and beyond to get me on the road in my new truck quickly to make the 500 mile drive home. They were grateful for my business and very appreciative. In all actuality, I should be the one thanking them for a pleasant transaction. Finding a 2500hd that met my picky needs is much easier said than done this day and age. Highly recommended! Google Aug 5, 2021 Chris Ivey is awesome. It would be worth your wild to ask for him. So so sweet. Made me, my daughter, my grandson and my dog feel right at home. Thanks again Chris. So wonderful and down to earth. Google Aug 4, 2021 Fast, complete, knowledgeable, competent, service and sales people, it was a very good experience. Thank you Google Aug 3, 2021 The buying process was easy. Clay helped me in every way he could. They worked directly with my lender and made the process simple. Google Jul 31, 2021 Always go there for my car, as that's where I purchased it Google Jul 30, 2021 They are a pretty laid back bunch who made the purchase of my new car a really good experience. Very willing to work with you to make the deal happen. Google Jul 29, 2021 Rusty Wallace Chevrolet, Clinton TN, I have a lot to say about these guys. The owner and Rusty Wallace sets the bar really high for their staff, from the GM, sales and the internet guys so they really try hard to meet that challenge. My opinion, given the chance and a reasonable opportunity, they will deliver every time. Check this out, I purchased a 2016 Silverado back in December 2019, used but very nice. About 16 months later, 59,678 miles, the number 6 cylinder misfire happened. This is a known issue by GM that sometimes happens to the vehicles that have the AFM system and it can be very expensive to fix. They worked with the manufacture to get my very expensive work done under the factory drivetrain warranty. You might say, well they should have as it was still under the 60,000 miles that GM allows but what you don’t know is the time was up back in March. Since I had been a loyal customer for many years and had previously brought up the fact that there was a noise in the engine, but nothing had broke, they went with that to argue on my behalf. I would challenge anyone to find a dealer that would do that for a regular customer anywhere in the country. They replace thousands of dollars in parts and days of labor and a very minimal cost to me and loaned me a car to drive during the whole outage. I can tell you one thing, I’ve been looking for a company that truly puts their customers first and I have found one. There will be no need for me to ever go anywhere else since they are local and care very much about customer service. Special thanks to Blake, Joe, Ron, Charlie and Tyrell for a superb job in customer service. What a team and what a place to find a new or used car without any hassle and fully supported after the sale. Where customer satisfactory is priority one for these guys and it shows.

The very next day after buying the car, a warning light came on, so I immediately called the dealership. Their response was that the car was sold "as is," leaving me with no real support or assistance.\n\nI decided to take the car to a trusted mechanic, who found two significant electrical issues that would cost a lot of money to fix. These aren’t just minor problems; they pose safety risks and could potentially make the car unsafe to drive. As I attempted to address one issue, more problems were uncovered, which further raised my concerns.\n\nWhen I returned to Grayson Hyundai to seek help, given that the car was not only unsafe but also had multiple issues, the only solution they offered was to go to a cheaper mechanic for repairs. This response was both frustrating and unhelpful, especially since the dealership should be standing behind the condition of the car they sold.\n\nOverall, I’m extremely dissatisfied with my experience at Grayson Hyundai. Not only was I sold a car with hidden electrical issues, but the lack of support or any willingness to resolve the situation has been extremely frustrating.

The first, I was without my car for over 2 months when I needed a new transmission at only 14,000 miles. I was forced to rent a car out of pocket for that time period which they promised would be reimbursed. When the work was finally finished corporate tried to tell me they would not pay for sales tax on the rental (over $200). I had to fight with them over the phone, submit a letter, and finally they said they would extend a “goodwill” (like they were doing me a favor) payment to cover the tax. I should not have had to pay anything out of pocket for a transmission that failed after only 14K miles.\n\nThis time, I took the car in to check for a vibration that they said they had fixed on my last visit. It was not. I was also due for an oil change and tire rotation. The service rep asked if they could keep my car for the week and since I was going out of town in a different car, I agreed. This was Tuesday 7:30am. Thursday was Thanksgiving, I obviously didn’t expect anything to happen as they were closed. I called at the end of the day on Friday (third working day they had my car) because I had heard nothing yet and my service rep had “just left for the day.” The gentleman I talked to said he would make sure I got an update the next day (Saturday). Saturday came and went with no update, this was no surprise based on my previous transmission experience that I had to call incessantly to try and get any updates at two week intervals. You call, get put on hold, and then hung up on. Lather, rinse, repeat. Anyway, I called back on Monday and after waiting on hold for my service advisor (apparently they are the only one in the building who can answer anything about your car) and was told that my car hadn’t even been looked at for the entire week they had it in their possession. No oil change, tire rotation, or investigation into the vibration. It had just sat there. I informed the service advisor that I would not be able to let them keep my car any longer as I need it to get to work, kids to school/activities, errands, etc. The service advisor called back after about 30 minutes and asked if I would like for them to at least perform the oil change and tire rotation and I agreed. I informed him I would need to pick up my car early at 7:00am when they opened and he said it would be fine. When my wife dropped me off at 7:10 the next morning there was no Hyundai service advisor in the building yet to help me, so I waited. Finally at 7:30 a Subaru service advisor offered to help me but was unsure of pricing since the two brands are on different systems and pricings. He tried his best but it took a little while. Finally at 7:45 I was finished and able to leave. There was still no Hyundai advisor who had arrived to work yet. If there was, they did not offer to help the Subaru advisor who was helping me, my original service advisor certainly was not present. You know the saying, burn me once, shame on me, burn me thrice, never again. I had gotten 3 free oil changes with the purchase of the car, which were decent services, everything else has been terrible.

Maybe the problem with Grayson Hyundai I experienced is a cancer that flows and permeates from Hyundai USA? I was assured by Hyundai USA they would take care of my issue, follow up with Grayson Hyundai, then follow up with me. What an absolute joke. I contacted Hyundai USA on November 5 - the day I had a terrible experience at Grayson Hyundai. I "missed" a surprise phone call from Tiara at Hyundai America late afternoon on Friday, 11/15. I replied with an email and voicemail on options for when I would be free. She said she would call back on 11/20, but never did. Then I missed another surprise phone call from her on 11/21 at 1:39 pm ET. I had already told her I am available from 8-12. She said she would call back on 11/26 but never did. I left her another message and voicemail that I would be free this entire week from 8-12 ET. End of week - no phone call. Her messages and answering service sound like she is calling from a machine shop in a factory.\n\nFolks if this is their idea of customer service you should absolutley BEWARE purchasing from an outfit like this. I truly loved my Hyundai automobile until this experience. I shudder at the thought of anything going seriously wrong after this. Terrible. Bad. Experience. Zero stars if I could.\n\nUPDATE: I received a condescending, misleading response from Grayson Hyundai below. For the record Grayson - you were lied to and completely mistaken about what actually happened - you should really investigate before you end up in a serious lawsuit. I will forward your response to Hyundai USA and my attorney. I was not there to be professional. I was not there to be scolded, lectured to, or reprimanded. I was there to pick up my car after warranted service. I was your customer. Period. Full stop. I explained to Josh jerkyman exactly what I wrote - I have already adressed the issue with Wolfchase and Hyundai, yet it is still a problem beyond my cause or control. Josh decided to pick a fight with me over "no more oil changes". You may charge $75 or so - the actual cost may be about $30 or so. You have lost a customer FOREVER and created a lawsuit for you, Hyundai USA and Wolfchase Hyundai over about a $40 missed profit. Who is unprofessional I ask you? Josh lied about what actually happened. Further reasons for ALL KNOXVILLIANS to avoid your dealership.\n\nOriginal post:\nWell I suffered a miserable experience with Josh at Grayson Hyundai Service today. Apparently Josh is the militant, antagonistic gatekeeper of service contracts. I was more or less scolded while he informed me this was my last oil change in the service contract because I had come in sooner for oil changes than I was supposed to. In a 5 minute provacation this jerk told me I wasn\'t the original owner, that a car with 15,000 miles is a used car, and that I am "lucky I found a car to buy for $35,000". He was whining about HAVING to pay $87,000 for some truck. Well - I am the ONLY owner of my car; I bought it with 15 miles (not 15k you jerk!); and maybe $35,000 isn\'t a lot of money to you, Josh, but it was to me. And you were wrong about the contract. And you were a jerk.\n\nFolks every single Hyundai or Kia dealership I have been to besides Grayson is nicer, and the employees seem to care more about your business and relationship than trying to impress the cute associate that was standing next to him or argue over future oil changes. It wasn\'t even necessary to bring it up except to pick a fight. It is worth it to drive across town or to a different city. I will never go back to Grayson Hyundai. Josh - Hyundai USA will be calling soon!', 'review_date': '2024-12-20 00:00:00'}, {'user_url': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109848779402049321725/reviews?hl=en', 'review_username': 'Mark McKeehan', 'rating': '5', 'review': 'We had a great experience.

My first visit to get my shaking tires inspected on my brand new vehicle I purchased from them resulted in a realignment and giving me the run around on who could replace them. Since they were on warranty through a third party which, the finance salesman didn’t explain, I was direct to Discount Tires then corporate Hancock which all said it should be replaced by the dealership and they REFUSED. During this same visit the service agents seemed like he didn’t know I had a loaner scheduled and brought it out 15 mins later and was absolutely filthy. It then took another 20 mins to properly clean the vehicle. I was late for work due to the inconvenience and lack of preparedness from this department.\n\nAfter familiarizing myself with my new car I later realized my heads up display is broken and displays blurred lines. I booked an appointment for today at 9:40 but asked to drop it off earlier to get to work on time. As I pull in to check in and drop off my vehicle the service agents seemed informed me it would be a week to be inspected by his Master Technician due to a back log of appointments and only one Master Technician. This was an additional inconvenience and waist of my time and should have been discussed when I scheduled my appointment so I could schedule a loaner. They didn’t have loaners available until Dec 9th! I had him reschedule my appointment.\n\nAt this point I’ve had this new car less than a year and will trade it in due to the absurd lack of skill, knowledge, preparedness, professionalism, and management within the Grayson Hyundai Service Department and Finance Department. The Service Department Managers Brad, Josh, and Steve need to be evaluated for their performance and lack of management skills for customers. I know I have not been the only person to experience this.\n\nGood luck Grayson. It’s certainly bringing down the brand of your vehicles.

When I walked on the lot we had NO idea what I wanted to do at the time. Michael was the kindest. And most patient salesman we have ever worked with! He listens to you and what you like. The fist thing we told him was that I hated tons of chrome,Reds, bright blues, and that I was more of an earthy toned colored gal. He look and my husband and I and said " believe it or not i have been listening I believe I ha ve the perfect vehicle for you and what you are looking for!" here I am now a owner of a beautiful forest green pathfinder! Not ONCE did we feel pressured in anyway. He was super kind kept us informed during the entire process and was able to make our expectations come to life!

He was just wonderful I highly recommend him and if you go see Michael, tell him that William and Haley Travis sent you I promise you won’t regret it! ...

Ask A Question Our Reviews Google Oct 14, 2021 I brought my truck in again concerning the 8 Speed transmission shifting and vibration issue. Service writer intake could have been better this time but they took it in and re-diagnosed it with no significant findings other than these seem to be a characteristic of the 8 Speed auto trans. The service manager did a good job of explaining that it was ok to drive and reassured me that it wasn\'t going to break down on me, I just need to drive it more and see how it goes, my truck only has a little over 12,000 miles on it. I dealt with Mark Beason when it was in the time before and they changed the fluid over to the synthetic fluid, and he did a good job of listening to my concerns and getting it back in for this evaluation. So far the service dept has done a great job of taking care of my truck, although sometimes it has taken a while to get an appointment but other than that I\'m happy with the service I\'ve received. Google Oct 9, 2021 Our salesman Andrew was amazing very helpful and made the process so easy. I will definitely recommend him and the dealership to everyone.

At that point they decided to tell me that GM will pay for a loaner vehicle for me. They told me to give them an hour and then come up and they would have a loaner for me. The final straw for me was when I arrived three hours later there was no loaner car waiting for me and was told just give me a few and I’ll work one for you. She then turned around and started joking around with the other employees. I stopped everything right there and just asked for my truck back. There was no concern or caring of any kind she just stated ok and went to get my truck. I did speak to the service manager but pretty much got the same response. Needless to say I would recommend staying as far away as possible. I have since started using a local Chevy dealer for all of my service and am much happier.

Was told that due to staffing/timing that only the oil change and tire rotation could be accomplished at that time. Since the waiting area was old and cramped I decided to wonder around, I watched my Denali move through the shop. Sure enough the oil did get changed but the tires didn't leave the ground. Service writer provided appt's at a later date where the remaining items could be taken care of. I picked a date and showed up on time, I was provided a rental for the inconvenience. Ok - day 2, I get an update that the Denali hasn't even been given a time slot to begin work. I called and was told that 'we are so short of technicians that we are backed up'. I ask when are you getting to my Denali? ' Uh, we don't know'. What was the point of setting a appt? Uh.....we provided you with a rental....Yes, but that's because the work that was needed would take longer than waiting. 'Uh....no we provided a rental because we can service your truck'. 'we don't have enough technicians'. Not my problem, don't make appts that you can't honor. Did you not know this when I brought the Denali in?
